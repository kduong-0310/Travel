This paper focuses on data collected by a travel agency on customer search behavior over two years (January 2013 to December 2014) and whether those searches lead to booking decisions.

Based on this analysis, I will segment the market, group customers based on certain similar characteristics, and then develop a model that allows me to predict whether customer searches lead to bookings.

1. Describe the dataset and the problem statement, what is the nature of this case?

2. Does the data have any defects or issues? State the solution if any!

3. What kind of model could be used in this case? Explain!

4. Perform data exploratory analysis (you could use descriptive analysis or charts)!

5. Is there any special point or potential issue that the analyst must pay attention to?
